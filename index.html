<p>LYTIE was a beautiful little water nymph who lived in a cave at the bottom of the sea. The walls of the cave were covered with pearls and shells. The floor was made of sand as white as snow.</p>

<p>There were many chairs of amber with soft mossy cushions. On each side of the cave-opening was a great forest of coral. Back of the cave were Clytieâ€™s gardens.</p>

<p>Here were the sea anemones, starfish and all kinds of seaweed.</p>

<p>In the garden grotto were her horses. These were the gentlest goldfish and turtles.</p>

<p>The ocean fairies loved Clytie and wove her dresses of softest green sea lace.</p>

<p>With all these treasures Clytie should have been happy, but she was not. She had once heard a mermaid sing of a glorious light which shone on the top of the water.</p>

<p>She could think of nothing else, but longed day and night to know more of the wonderful light.</p>

<p>No ocean fairy dared take her to it, and she was afraid to go alone.</p>

<p>  One day she was taking her usual ride in her shell carriage. The water was warm and the turtles went so slowly that Clytie soon fell asleep. On and on they went, straight towards the light, until they came to an island.</p>
